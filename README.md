Hello, I am Elie Alarou, thank you for bringing to my attention the error i was making when implementing the interceptor, I have fixed the issue and continued and implemented an AuthGuard for the /countries that redirects the user to login page if not holding token (authenticated). I am sorry i did not have enough time to implement the remaining objectives. Thank you for the time you spent to help us!
